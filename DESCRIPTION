Description: Computes partial eta-squared effect sizes for fixed effects in
    linear mixed models fitted with lme4 package. Supports crossed and nested random
    effects structures with any number of grouping factors. Random slope
    variances are translated to the outcome scale using a variance decomposition
    approach, correctly accounting for predictor scaling and interaction terms.
    Both general and operative effect sizes are provided.
